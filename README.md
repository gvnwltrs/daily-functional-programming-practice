# daily-functional-programming-practice

## Goal: Simple implementations in 15-30 minutes or less for daily practice of functional programming and TDD principles. 

## Month 1: Python - September 2024

### Day 1: Monday, September 9, 2024 - Pure Functions
Just added a few test and simple pure functions to practice functional programming + TDD in Python for today. Pure functions should not have any side effects, such that they do not depend on any outside global, state, or dependency to perform an operation. 

### Day 2: Tuesday, September 10, 2024 - Higher-Order Functions
Starting with high-order functions today. Basically passing a function to another function or return a function from a function.
